// Every C program uses libraries, in order to use the very basic print function (printf) you must include the `stdio.h` header file.
#include <stdio.h>

// This part is where the real code will reside. The first part of C code will always be apart of the `main` function.
int main() {
	printf("Hello world!"); // This will print "Hello world!" (without the quotes)
	return 0; // I'm not sure what this does. When I commented it out the output program doesn't seem to change in terms of printing. This doesn't print 0
}
// I believe all C code that is in a function must end with a semicolon (;)
