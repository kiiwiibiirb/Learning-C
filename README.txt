This is a public repository on me learning the C programming language. This is 
mainly for my personal use, though I'm keeping it public in case anyone wants 
to use this as an "example" (don't know why you would want to though...)

I have little experience in coding, though I understand stuff about it I don't 
program a lot, I'm hoping that will change with me learning how to write in C.

Each thing I learn will be in directories, and they are labelled so you know 
what is in it, but just in case you don't understand what each directory is, 
here's a listing:

hello-world - Simple program that outputs "Hello world!" from the terminal and 
nothing else.

vars-types - First time using variables and types.

arrays - What the fuck do you think this is?

conditions - if, if else, else, and other logical operators/conditions!

NOTE: Yes, I know I have a fuckton of comments in my code, it's more or less 
for me to look back on when I need to so I can remember what does what. I won't 
turn ever C program I make into a textbook lmao
